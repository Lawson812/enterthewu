var lyrics = ["It’s been taught that your worst enemy couldn’t harm you as much as your own wicked thoughts.", "Peace is the absence of confusion.", "Envy, greed, lust, and hate, separate.", "Wu Tang is for the children", "Here I go, deep type flow. Jacques Cousteau could never get this low", "I'm taking one for the team, Martin Luther King, I'm taking one for a dream","Behind every fortune, there's a crime", "It's harder to make the glass than to break the glass","Confusion is a gift from God. Those times when you feel most desperate for a solution, sit. Wait. The information will become clear. The confusion is there to guide you. Seek detachment and become the producer of your life.","Dedicated to babies who came feet first"];
